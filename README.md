 How It Works

1. **Usage Tracking:**
   - TrackWise runs in the background, logging data about the apps you use.
   - It records information such as the name of the app and the duration of use.

2. Data Analysis:
   - The collected data is stored in a CSV file for easy management and review.
   - Note that the CSV file is hidden, so it won't appear directly on you file explorer

3. **Visual Insights:**
   - Open the visualizations window to view graphs and charts summarizing your app usage. 
   - Choose to visualize your usage over specific time intervals, with various graph types, and for all apps, individual apps, or the top 5 most used apps.
