## How It Works

1. **Usage Tracking:**
   - TrackWise runs in the background, logging data about the apps you use.
   - It records information such as the name of the app and the duration of use.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - The collected data is stored in a CSV file for easy management and review.
   - Note that the CSV file is hidden, so it won't appear directly on you file explorer

3. **Visual Insights:**
   - Open the visualizations window to view graphs and charts summarizing your app usage. 
   - If no data exists, the app gracefully displays a "No data" message.

4. **Export Data:**
   - Easily export your usage data to a CSV file for external use.

5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - Use `auto-py-to-exe` to package the app, ensuring compatibility with other PCs without the need for Python installation.
